# A Climate Server in Python for testing Azure Deployment

This is forked from [TomasKindahl](https://github.com/TomasKindahl/azclimate) and the purpose is to try out Azure deployment  

## Run it locally

To run the server locally first (assuming mac/linux):  
`python3 -m venv venv`  
`source venv/bin/activate`  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
`python3 climateserver.py`  

Next time you only need:  
`source venv/bin/activate`  
`python3 climateserver.py`
